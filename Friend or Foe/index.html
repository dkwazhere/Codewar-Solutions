    Description:
    Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
    <br>
    If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be
    sure he's not...
    <br>

    Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
    <br>

    Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

    function friend(friends) {
      //your code here
      return friends.filter(n => n.length === 4);
    }
